            The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
            companies has allowed me to develope a skillset that helps me in not
            just development, but in every aspect of any business.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
            largest communities teaching young minds about how to <em>
              sell
            </em>{" "}
            yourself as a developer and open then to a whole new world of
            opportunities.

            As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
            holding you back is yourself.

            <br />
            A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.
            <br />
            <br />
            "How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't
            fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a
            developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in
            something you're passionate about.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
            company.
